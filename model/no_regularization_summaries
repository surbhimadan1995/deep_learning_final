the glowing lightning bolts , fireballs , etc look like they came from a cheesy 70 ' s sci-fi flickthe cast looks good when you read the credits , but translates into an ageing , flabby mess of phony pompadours , blood , and brylcreem and one fright wig a sense of sadness and regret permeates the production5 ) don ' t miss iti definitely give this movie a 10 it deserves nothing lessin support actors like sidney greenstreet , stanley ridges , arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends , foes , or even treacherous sneaks ( kennedy ) anyway , going of the subject here everyone always enjoyed it it ' s actually a great movie for kids , tooin the film they do that ' ll learn me this movie is apparently based on a true story , and it ' s a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change luckily , there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder also , keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses by comparison , wagner looks relatively timeless , with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suitslike i said , a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood in the end you just want everyone to die already now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had , but not here hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934 very creepy 7 out of 10please understand , i ' m not in any way , shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie , and i ' m not trying to " attack " this imdb listing i ' m just telling it like it isas history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired but after that there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back , of people demanding their money back i kid you not why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it , but the melodies are basically tuneless( like the birthday party ) the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done " as for " unidentified " rent it if you must , but screen it before you show it to a non-christian or a larger audiencepolice officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini-series ' scrubs 'also , it ' s a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse who can forget california joe , the great " queen ' s own buttler " with his song " garryowen " , the touching mrs custer ( olivia de havilland ) , the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso0 out of 10 , actually below if possible not worth the dvd or tape it is onnever try to link this story to the facts and the real persons , it doesn ' t work out the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film , but all in all this is a great romantic story the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs : the #1 hit " who ' s that girl " , the #2 hit " causing a commotion " and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads " the look of love ' ' ( top 10 hit in the uk ) and " can ' t stop " a left over pop ditty from the ' true blue ' sessions the year before the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot , and some of the supporting performances are quite awful by the time of the big horserace finale , most viewers will have had enoughthat ' s really cool overall i ' d say this is the single greatest film of the genre , nay , in the worldit has some of hollywood ' s most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiastthe last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile , with some potent killing sequences and fine make-up effects on the monster ( who turns out to be lurch from " the addams family " movies ) , but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiecechrisopher walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he ' s letting on if you like " who ' s that girl there are much better films in this vein , but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn ( 1981 ) , wrong turn ( 2003 ) , or even the final terror ( 1983 ) againgave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levelsrather , the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely - both of yourself and others "not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea a first grader telling you a story about nap time is more entertainingso , i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations skip this pile of pine sap and rent " halloween , " instead this is rated ( r ) for physical violence , mild gun violence , gore , some profanity , brief female nudity , mild sexual content , sexual references , and drug abusei was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiecepicasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime you simply don ' t get anything like this in the western world , sadly , and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade highly recommended viewing in my opinion , a real joy and scarethe whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year if you ' re only gonna see one norwegian movie this year , this is the oneon a down note , the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001 , so it ' s really cheesy sometimes ( the beatles crap , etc ) the ending , as in " miracle , " is not some disney creation , but one that only human history could have written l i did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movieall in all : a classic this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan unless you are under 7 years old , i recommend watching something elsebtw anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bedyou might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is custer ' s last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle , a savage clash between red men and white , with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men fast forward ( actually , you ' ll want to fast-forward through much of this mess ) to the present day , where a couple of campers are butchered ; the teens follow in their wake , while a semi-concerned park ranger ( a sleepwalking jackie coogan ) and his healthier cohort ( who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo ) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding finally , more killings--but nothing you haven ' t seen a zillion times beforedon ' t watch it - it ' s pure propaganda and its pure wrong  ) however , i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode ( even if his screen time is very limited ) not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b-movie enthusiastswhichever way you choose to interpret this film , it is one that demands an open-minded approach , rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general if you don ' t like a movie that shows the better side of human nature , you ' ll hate it as i understand it , bronson disowned this film , but happily cashed the check from golan globus if you enjoy quality movies , avoid this one , but if you ' re in for a cheap " jackass " kind of thrill , check it out8 i didn ' t think it was possible , but the adventures of hercules makes the first film , hercules ( 1983 ) , look like an academy award winnerthose two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome filmand ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don ' t know why we can ' t have more movies like this , rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basisi can highly recommend this movie this " sequel " is moronic , cheap , unredeemable , childish , phony , inept and badly acted a landmark in bad cinema , and one of the few , few movies i ' ve seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating : no starsavoid this rated r for graphic violence , nudity and sexual situationsthey feature great animation and taut , fast-moving plots the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be , and he seemed to be the average angry " d " student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called " victims " 3/10 just expect this one in the daily funniesin the meantime , i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting the legend of hell house , the changeling , ringu , the grudge ( japanese original ) and one missed call ( japanese original ) are good places to starti wish they made more movies like this stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end for all we know , native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better this movie should be stamped right on the box : caution : contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposesit would deserve a 10 if it weren ' t for the racist minstrelization of african americans this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone , and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horror well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better this movie is fifty years old now time hasn ' t decreased its power in any wayi also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal my grandmother was the center of my family for years , but i don ' t really feel this did anything to help women ' s rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself , some women were offended by her project) miss itprobably one of the best of all the cartoons just greatthis is , of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence , as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture should not even be as high as a " b " had a laugh at how jaded i ' ve become over the years in his best " aw shucks " attitude , john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers , and alas , randy rides alone no more 25 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film this is one of hitchcock ' s most emotionally effective films no argument there this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenithactually the film slowly evolves to something very different , at slow pace , but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty , so i will not say much more watch " friday the 13th " again and burn any copy of this film you find it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever madei think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potentialthe relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together , and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after  we got the family together and prepared food all in all , this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk seriously , a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along , and that ' s not a good thing in my book fans of " beat " takeshi : his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo , and unless you ' re a rabid fan , you don ' t need to suffer through this waste of filmi don ' t usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating ( must be cast/crew ) i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story , read about it , its much more gripping and conclusiveand madonna can act this is for slasher completists only this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finishone would think there ' d at least be some humor value do yourself a favor skip this onei ' m sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn ' t help matters either at the end of the film , in the midst of the movie ' s second funeral , i found myself thinking , " now , what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast , including martin balsam ( " psycho " , " 12 angry men " ) as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet , ed lauter ( " family plot " , " the longest yard " ) as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter ( from " bill and ted ' s excellent adventure ) in his debut role as one of the thugsthe only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff justthis is one i ' d recommend to anyone watch it & forget about it down beat ending and all , this is great fun  although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is , as i mentioned before , a very sad one they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner i rate this film capital f minusi love bad melodrama as much as the next person but this movie was great , and i suggest that you go see it before you judge the last half hour is particularly outstanding , especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership , followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventurewith the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as " life ' s unwanted gherkins " by the flame-glow demon , you wonder whether hell really is a mcdonalds i sat riveted to the tv screen and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears kathleen quinlan ' s role as a hooker/killer wasn ' t fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill/nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast , you might be able to track down the cd , one touch of venus ( 1943 original cast ) / lute song ( 1946 original cast ) an easy 10/10 please watch this movie and if you ' re new to foreign films , this is a great start great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time lou myers , as half-step wilson , provides many hilarious momentsi like this one a lot , check it out 8 out of 10this is most notably during the scene in which count de lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night it ' s the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film , the rest is fairly mediocre and déjà-vua horrible , horrible , horrible film highly recommendedearlier , a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer ' s character , when he stated - " you take glory with you when it ' s your time to go " " for those who have outgrown the naked gun series , this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going plus , the acting was great , and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie , and i still to this day dont understand whymy only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7 hack shows and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall , a delightwell worth it word to the wise : vote yourself off this island )flynn looks , and acts , the part of the dashing cavalier and the " garry owen " is always nice to hearit ' s not just the actors that are bad , but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazywhat stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b-movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the genuineness of the movieridiculous , that people would abuse the media to such a degree definitely not light viewing ; watch this one when you really want to think about what you ' ve seen it ' s a hell of a puzzleri really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material in conclusion , wisards of waverly place is a disappointmentif you like suspenseful movies , this is the one to watch wilkinson is terrific , even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson , ( the adulterous wife ) , and rupert everett , ( the highly amoral high-class totty ) , are both very good at covering the cracks in the material tony pierce-roberts ' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it ' s always good on the eye7 out of 10 and that ' s being kind gooding was flawless radio is an inspirationjust a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn ' t help but find some appreciation for this little film , if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes byboring long sometimes even stupid pford taught us in " liberty valance " to believe the legend before the truth g bicycle race )it most definitely do not deserve any recognition dullsville you watch " friends " , " married wtih children " , " fraizer " if you laugh at that , you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever the actors/actresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them stucking in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world ( reba )the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining rating : better than average , hitchcock ' s enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy itdon ' t be drawn in by the video box art of jaclyn screaming while taking a shower she does indeed take a shower in this film , but it is not revealing ( nor does it further the murky plot one iota )some fading is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level: make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt , which stars annie & al but also another famous screen couple , laura gemser and gabriele tinti i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans if you really hate someone , invite them over for a double feature of this movie and " the terror of tiny town , " an all midget western from the 1930 ' s and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open " a clockwork orange " style what the real story is completely ignored , the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas how they built the dinos in #1 and malcom ' s chaos ramblings ) was disappointing as well in short , the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some moneyotherwise , it ' s simply not very interesting , and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan s she gives cuba the nickname " radio " and what follows is an absoutely riveting , engrossing , poignant exploration of the human soul the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece6/10 ps the concert was lousyhis men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it  give it a gopoodle schnitz patriotic , for all the right reasons it ' s awful and i don ' t even have a clue how it got any distribution you won ' t be disappointed and bring your kleenex) but , after all , uncharacteristically for me , i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something , no there reba gets 2/10the only thing that made me think it wasn ' t made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you ' ll see what i meandid an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy , a aif you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy , rent this movie for them you will both be cheerio prontoneither film is a big deal , but both are easy to enjoy grade : b+watch this masterpiece as soon as possible my rating : 10 out of 10this movie was going through " the motions " i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see itthe audience i saw it with left the theater in silence davethe thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value , a meager cast , and no action , no romance , no sex or nudity , no heavy drama ( c- )radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies  my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white ; wished it had been in color wow ) of its predecessors ( " death on the nile " , " evil under the sun " ) and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go ( of course , he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot ) the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie ' s plot alone ( all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest ) , but the direction is hopelessly flati rate it the second best western ever , right behind wayne ' s the cowboys the plot is something out of an episode of " highway to heaven " and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don ' t even get any satisfaction from bronson ' s revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend even then , it is still well worth a look 8 out of 10at any rate , there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon , like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes oh yeah , and bob mitchum is in there too i intend to see this movie again in a near future title ( brazil ) : " medo " ( " fear " )some may know him from films like ' troll ' and ' friday the 13th part 7 - he directed both these films ) all in all , this isn ' t a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact , on a hollywood level , this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts , but for that handful ( yet very loyal ) of slasher movie fans in the world , even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiventhis film has little to do with real history it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was producedan extremely tragic , heart-breaking story , then i see no reason not to recommend it very inspiring and uplifting highly recommendedone final note the show might be a bit better , actually , if they replaced all the actors , especially reba herself , who is more community- theater quality than prime-time sitcom quality i give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in( the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams , barrels , oak and cork ) a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in generalthe movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film( if you ' ve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you ' ll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on ) i ' m not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror , and don ' t mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawlif i wasn ' t on a bus i would have walked out on the movie anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarnedit was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it this " thing even so i ' d still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made , second only to " nail gun massacre "fortunately jon ' s new girlfriend is allergic to cats with slicker animation than past tv specials , this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friendsshe ' s trying to be funny but she just isn ' t and then she got a stupid accent so here ' s the recipe to get a great showonce they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie movie is ok if you don ' t mind knowing you already have seen it before" radio " , while being sentimental , will warm anyone ' s heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for ussurprising it was made in 1980 ; seems somewhat ahead of it ' s time i would definitely look out for this on dvd frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus , while the killer ' s mask-covered face was in close-up but out of focus in the background that would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller ) if you ' re attracted to the box , rent the video , you won ' t regret it i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album not to bad hughthis is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work againit ' s also a film that requires repeated viewing , even though no one will never really " get it " for a full 100% " horrible acting , horrible editing , horrible story , and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard horrible7 out of 10 ( flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life ) the other complaint , though minor , i had about the movie was that it was a little " too polished " and " hollywood-esque " the small budget and tight schedule were apparent is that asking too much my score : 4/10a true 1 out of 10 i love laughing at bad movies , but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualitiesthe film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you , and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever they might as well have called this movie " the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choojust watch the remake and you ' ll enjoy it i give the movie a 9 out of 10there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously " - " thanks oh wello = satan ' s evil doingsyou can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it but , the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour ini ' ve heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can ' t begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry , everyone laugh , and most everyone will leave smilingyeah ill eat it if i ' m hungry and i don ' t feel like cooking , but i ' m well aware it tastes like crap 3 stars , mehif all the camera zooms on still shots , and scans of walls were taken out , it would have been much shorter all i can say is i ' m glad there wasnt a sequelthe final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin ' s modern times as elisabeth , approaching complete meltdown by now , and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge , clumsily clasping each other ' s outstretched hands  the sets are cheap , the script is filled with clichés and failed humor , and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor ( as indeed he was ) in short , if you want to see ava in her prime , buy a photo and stay well clear of this moviewe have , however , accepted straight copies of other peoples ' ideas for western films for years , and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10 there have been so many movie , where the main character is skit-so ( the machinist , secret window and so on ) , but this movie is way better than them but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy  keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honourwho ' s that girl she ' s the girl for meit ' s actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like thisit is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man ( fahey ) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possiblealthough this is a " light hitchcock " , one can ' t dismiss it as a failure story start with 2 main characters , 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone ' s soul with this con-descendant attitude in a few words : this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes waste of time , waste of moneypeace garybah : /the jamaican resort is so beautiful you ' ll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night , with a run ' n ' coke i know i didmy dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films , there is some similarity here , particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space although largely undistinguished , the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and , following the sound of a closing door , remains at the center while the camera ' s eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty great performances by lou myers and brian ' s neighbor , alex it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond can be fun but overall it isn ' t a great movie and is certainly one of wayne ' s weaker outings you are guaranteed a good time hey , has garfield ever let you down beforealthough i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and geniusthe only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is bettersure i love it because of madonna but who cares - it ' s damn funny ( note : the cast credits at the end aren ' t too helpful )it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor as for the story , it ' s a blending of elements from better films and stories , including ten little indians , the most dangerous game , and escape from new york the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fansdonald sutherland , cristopher plummer , faye dunaway and sarah miles ( far from her good performance in " ryan ' s daughter " ) just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either lopez ' smug , self-satisfied , snotty performance and , again , she ' s the heroineafter that , the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear note : it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that , in real life , in took years for " radio " to make his transformation , not months as shown in the filmnone of the characters were likable , or even capable of drawing my sympathy i think it would be a complete waste of time sincerely i never though i would say something like that about a movie but there ' s always a first timeshe is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings , skin lacerations , anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the ' tart-with-a-heart ' still - i did watch it to the end , by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue ' s tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly , pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hourit does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end , and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him i ' ve never found her attractive , and i don ' t find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth so if you haven ' t seen it yet , then find a copy , pop it into your dvd-player , go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it ' s 110 minutes running time we still have all the old favorites too , but on a personal note , one thing that always irritated me was this " duke in charge " stuff , when there are tons of other *officers* around instead the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well ; the main trick here seems to be the cgithe settings were nicely done i liked the colours , a good job conveying that time periodbutit ' s not so bad , especially for those who like the 80 ' s : it ' s such a ramshackle , trash , colorful and joyful action movie at the end , it ' s very funny to watch itmarion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies , and he hopes to use the vampire ' s corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire ' s lack of a normal reflection ( at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection , we see the vampire ' s skeleton but for a film to do that , it ' s great the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing , which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite 4/10and the happy ending who´s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like meenjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath " who loves everyoneas is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i ' m still puzzling over that one myself nowthe first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low-key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest there ' s a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wastedhow people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck don ' t get fooled like we did and buy this failureit ' s one of the worst movies i ' ve ever seen , and that ' s something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earththe singing is " schrecklich " the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing , a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eightiesa sad waste of effort by all involved , a veritable " jumping of the shark " for the shrek franchise get real people as for gore , there isn ' t too much , although there ' s an ok face squishing moment at the end the introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make go see " shrek " againmy copy is an 8 track i pirated years ago i hope it laststhe animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fansperhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it ' s written , directed and produced by the same person , and never ever expect anything of value from jeff faheythe story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it ' s entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated this gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10dunne makes a great foil , while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée yes , it ' s predictable , yes , the jokes could be better , but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times morethe common man can save the neighborhood , save the day to sum it up , this is far from being the original death wish , but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot ' em upi ' m surprised she wasn ' t even nominated ****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen , but it was sienna miller ' s performance that was truly oscar worthy moreover i would like to note that i don ' t know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he ' s famous for but it fails to work here and there ' s many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distractingit ' s hitchcock-light , but recommended gary fas i ' ve mentioned ; this is not hitchcock ' s best film , but there ' s much to enjoy about it and although i ' d recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one , i ' ll definitely give it two thumbs up as well that may have a hard core horror fan disappointed , but for a mystery fan like me , this film is a must see ( 9 out of 10 )overall rating : do not rent if you wanna have great fun , don ' t hesitate and check this one ferrigno is incredibly bad but is also the best of this mediocrityin the end , though , through luck , felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurrayone remake that i ' m really excited about is " dark water " coming out this summer despite the formulaic nature , this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience of course i also loved seeing joe barbara - especially since another world went off the air  and new lows of misogyny : the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight , whether by rape , explosion or throat-slashing ; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion , like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden , gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger , or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck , pure and simple , mindless garbage put together without style or sensethe man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes fantasticif you are going to watch only one " babes in bikini " movie , this is it  if you have yet to see ' a tale of two sisters ' , i strongly recommend locating a copy ( 10/10 )i couldn ' t blame him if he did it is not an agatha christie movie golan-globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling , rather than the snug atmosphere of english mysteryit ' s called taste lou myers was very funny as half-step wilson any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non-movie related scenes scattered throughout the movieif dame agatha christie were alive she would die laughing the movie is that badfast or at least finish high school no screenplay , no deep characters , nothing special macy , a talented actor who i ' ve never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can ' t save the movie , nor can the well computer-created dinosaursbut it was just a rumor 1 out of 10 one to watch again and again , if only to work it all out trashy , brain-deadening reality tv well directed , well acted a fine filmeverything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up , so i ' ll leave it minor spoiler alert but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes , with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two , really does it for mehitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin " storm cloud cantata " for almost ten minutes while scene in london ' s royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both , the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous it is rich and colorful recommendedgaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on , she turns off film ' s sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke , pre- " miracle worker " , as niven ' s daughter" and i might add , become a new actor , one bound to art and life like lennon , he has gained success without a loss of identitythe bottom line is it ' s not a very good film , even as a thrill ride * out of 4 starswell worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommendedheck nobody could do it better i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves itunfortunately due to the type of movie this is , there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its ' a tale of two sisters ' and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time3/10 is probably going easy on this waste of time but bringing something new or interesting to the street-gang tragedy genre might ' ve been nice you ' ll see what i mean i would always highly recommend this film , despite not being the best hitchcock film , it ' s still a treasureesbjørn nordby birch denmark1ch , without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and don ' t forget to switch the light offit ' s just too tired i ' ll give this film 10 out of 10 we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes thank younot even a kid would enjoy this something to switch off if possiblethe remake has excellent production quality , an endearing doris day , and a really creepy villain don ' t bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and overand it ' s hard to go away without the tune of " garryowen " threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter plus for us french speaker ( tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language ) there the usual videoville bad translation in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking ( you have to check on lips etc ) here you just have to listen to it and you know itbut if i had been , i would no longer be afraid of hell why do we do this to ourselves , anyway others will watch this movie and learn hate him i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western filmbut , it ' s room for mr atkins , when the troopship ' s on the tidethis is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release 4 starsjimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock , the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function , but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock ' s black and white , low-budget original rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars ( stallone , sheen , travolta , etc ; ) trying to act others might see the movie as boring because it ' s just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dadrarely would hitchcock include humor in his films , this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anythingyou ' ll be hanging on your seats during that moment bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre , do the streetwise , ' troubled minds ' routine that they are so good at portraying so be it now said they could get very upset have a nice day everyoneway to go hitch i give it three thumbs way up well , there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments- i couldn ' t contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon-walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes- my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag ; and the phoney looking " a tale of two sisters " is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper , and i was bored sorry , duke , but this gets a 1the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances " they died with their boots on " benefits from a top-notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune " gary owen "things aren ' t helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he ' s wearing a cheap darth maul mask , which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors you are just a big fony hypocrite another question , why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson ' s character this was not a great movie and i could go on , but i won ' t i felt really sad about how , if you were mentally retarded , you wouldn ' t really be able to understand death an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing , the guys may not be well known actors , but this is good down to earth real humour , with real people , and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen well donethe image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace ( a money-making idea for felix ' s near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss ) cannot be described--it must be viewed fans of this short of thing ( and , apparently , there are many ) will enjoy it , others ( *1/2 )****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen , but it was sienna miller ' s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards" my rating : 8/10 eliason a you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism ***spoiler*** plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health professionsir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest ( it ' s not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ( " vertigo " , " strangers on a train " ) , but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces not that bad considering everything , but not that great either i ' d really give it a 4 and a half this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom everthere was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers , but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movieforget hollywood don ' t miss iti know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who ' ll drink my blood while listening to busted , but that ' s a risk i ' m willing to take
